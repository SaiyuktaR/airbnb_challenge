## MAKERSBNB CHALLENGE

We are going to write a small Airbnb clone that will allow the users to create listings, as well as search and book properties.

## SETTING UP THE DATABASE

1. Connect to `psql` (you may need to install postgresql first by running `brew install postgres`)
2. Create the database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE makersbnb`
3. Connect to the database using the psql command `\c makersbnb`
4. Run the queries we have saved in the file **01_create_tables.sql**
5. Populate your tables by running the queries we have saved in the file **02_insert_table_data.sql**

To check you have everything set up ok, please take a look at the `listing`, `booking`, `calendar`, `users` and `hosts` tables inside the makersbnb database.

## SETTING UP THE TEST DATABASE

1. Connect to `psql`
2. Create the test database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE makersbnb_test`
3. Connect to the database using the psql command `\c makersbnb_test`
4. Run the queries we have saved in the file **01_create_tables.sql**

## START THE APP

- Run `bundle install` to add predefined package dependencies
